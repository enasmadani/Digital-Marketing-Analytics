Digital Marketing Dashboard
 Project Overview
This project is a Digital Marketing Analytics Dashboard designed to visualize and analyze marketing campaign performance using key performance indicators (KPIs). The dashboard provides clear insights into financial performance, audience behavior, platform effectiveness, and campaign efficiency to support data-driven decision-making.
The project was developed as a team collaboration by me and my teammate, with shared responsibilities across data analysis, dashboard design, and reporting.
